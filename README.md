## Building

First you'll need development tools. To install them use `npm` (I prefer `yarn`): `npm install`.

Then, to build project once, run `npm run-script build` (I use `yarn build`).

To start watching for changes in source files (developer mode), run `npm run-script watch`. This script also starts
a live reloading webserver, so it is very handy for development, since you don't need to install and configure any
other software - just open in your browser [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).
